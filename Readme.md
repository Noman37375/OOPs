// Sure, here's a simple project idea for a fresher to practice OOP concepts in TypeScript, focusing on inheritance:

// ### Project Idea: Library Management System

// **Description:**
// Create a Library Management System that allows the user to manage books and their categories. The system should have basic functionalities like adding books, displaying books, and categorizing them.

// **Requirements:**

// 1. **Classes:**//    - `Category`: Represents a category of books with properties like `name` and `description`.
//    - `Library`: Manages the collection of books and categories.

//    - `Book`: Represents a book with properties like `title`, `author`, `ISBN`, and `category`.

// 2. **Inheritance:**
// understand the concept o    - Create a class `EBook` that inherits from `Book` and has additional properties like `fileSize` and `format`.
//    - Create a class `PrintedBook` that inherits from `Book` and has additional properties like `pageCount` and `publisher`.

// 3. **Methods:**
//    - In `Library` class, add methods to:
//      - `addBook(book: Book)`: Add a book to the library.
//      - `removeBook(ISBN: string)`: Remove a book from the library by its ISBN.
//      - `findBook(ISBN: string)`: Find a book in the library by its ISBN.
//      - `listBooks()`: List all books in the library.
//      - `addCategory(category: Category)`: Add a category to the library.
//      - `listCategories()`: List all categories in the library.

// 4. **Interaction:**
//    - Create a simple command-line interface or a minimal web interface where the user can perform the above operations.

// **Steps:**

// 1. Define the `Book` and `Category` classes with the appropriate properties and methods.
// 2. Implement the `EBook` and `PrintedBook` classes that inherit from `Book`.
// 3. Define the `Library` class with methods to manage books and categories.
// 4. Implement the interface for user interaction.

// This project will help a fresherf inheritance and how it can be used to extend classes in TypeScript.
